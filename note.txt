This installs the application tftpgui.pyw and assumes you already
have the Python interpreter installed on your system.

It also assumes the .pyw extension is associated with your python
interpreter, so when tftpgui.pyw is run, it will automatically be
run as "pythonw tftpgui.pyw".

If you do not understand any of this - then do not proceed with
this installation.
